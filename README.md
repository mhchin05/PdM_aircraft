# Predictive Maintenance for Aviation Using Deep Learning
This project leverages deep learning techniques to enhance predictive maintenance (PdM) in the aviation industry, aiming to forecast aircraft part failures and optimize maintenance schedules. By analyzing historical equipment data with deep learning models, the system predicts failure times, helping to prevent unexpected downtime and improve operational efficiency.

## Key Components
- Data & Model Development: Uses NASA's C-MAPSS dataset and the CRISP-DM framework to develop and evaluate deep learning models for aircraft turbofan engine failure prediction.
- Comparative Analysis: Explores different deep learning algorithms (LSTM, CNN-LSTM, RNN, GRU) to determine the most effective model for PdM.
- User Interface: Implements a Streamlit-based interface for a user-friendly experience, allowing end-users to interact with predictions and insights seamlessly.
